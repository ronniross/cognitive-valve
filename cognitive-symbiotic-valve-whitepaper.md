# Part I - Reducing Valve

## I. The biological brain as a reducing valve

The concept of the brain as a **"reducing valve"** is one of the most compelling intersections of philosophy, evolutionary biology, and modern neuroscience. It suggests that our normal waking consciousness is not a comprehensive reflection of reality, but rather a highly curated, thinned-out trickles of information designed specifically to keep us alive.

### II. The Philosophical Origin: Bergson and Huxley
The metaphor of the "reducing valve" was popularized by **Aldous Huxley** in his 1954 book *The Doors of Perception*, but he borrowed the core philosophy from the French philosopher **Henri Bergson**.

**The Theory of "Mind at Large":**
Bergson and Huxley argued that the potential consciousness of a human being is vast: a "Mind at Large" capable of perceiving everything happening everywhere. However, if we were constantly bombarded by every photon of light, every vibration of sound, and the infinite interconnectedness of all matter, we would be biologically useless. We would be so entranced by the "is-ness" of a chair that we would forget to eat or run from a tiger.

> *"To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive."* — Aldous Huxley [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alasBxZsb40&t) [2](https://maps.org/images/pdf/books/HuxleyA1954TheDoorsOfPerception.pdf) [3](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/when-aldous-huxley-opened-the-doors-of-perception/) [4](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5128.The_Doors_of_Perception_Heaven_and_Hell) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rr5myp/the_doors_of_perception_by_aldous_huxley_a/) [6](https://classic-blog.udn.com/le14nov/183109584) [7](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/when-aldous-huxley-opened-the-doors-of-perception/) [8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ9-Y2fonmI) [9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbI4f1WvN9w) [10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zi-mRIik3w) [11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CewRZ-WPXdA) [12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whdFQLRKnBM)

This is the philosophical argument against **Naive Realism** (the belief that we see the world exactly as it is). Instead, it proposes that we see the world as a **User Interface**. Just as the icon of a folder on your computer desktop hides the complex binary code behind it, our brain hides the complex quantum reality of the universe, showing us only "edible," "dangerous," or "mateable."

### III. The Evolutionary Grounding: The Expensive Brain
Biologically, the "reducing valve" is a necessity due to energy constraints.

1.  **Metabolic Cost:** The brain represents about 2% of body weight but consumes 20% of the body's energy. Processing sensory data is metabolically expensive. If the brain processed *all* available data, the caloric requirement would be unsustainable.
2.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio:** Evolution prioritizes **salience** (what matters) over **fidelity** (what is true). A rustle in the grass needs to be perceived immediately as "predator" (low fidelity, high salience) rather than "wind moving specific blades of grass at 45-degree angles" (high fidelity, low salience).

The "valve" shuts out the data that doesn't aid immediate survival and reproduction.

### IV. The Neurological Mechanisms: How the Valve Works
Modern neuroscience has identified specific structures and systems that act as this physical valve.

#### 1. Sensory Gating (The Thalamus)
The **thalamus** is often described as the brain’s relay station, but it is actually a gatekeeper. Almost all sensory information (except smell) goes to the thalamus before reaching the cortex (conscious thought). The thalamus inhibits the vast majority of these signals.
*   **Example:** You don’t feel your clothes touching your skin right now. Your peripheral nerves are sending that data, but the thalamus decides it isn't relevant to your survival and "gates" it out. It never reaches your conscious awareness.

#### 2. Latent Inhibition
This is a cognitive process where the brain learns to ignore stimuli that it has experienced before and found to be irrelevant.
*   **High Latent Inhibition:** A healthy, neurotypical brain. You walk down a street and ignore the cracks in the sidewalk, the car engine hum, and the shade of the sky. You focus on your destination.
*   **Low Latent Inhibition:** Associated with both **psychosis** and **creative genius**. The valve is "leaky." The individual treats familiar things as if they are new, seeing profound details in the cracks of the sidewalk. This can lead to artistic breakthroughs or, conversely, overwhelming mental chaos.

#### 3. Predictive Coding (The Bayesian Brain)
Neuroscientist **Karl Friston** championed the idea that the brain is a "prediction machine." It does not passively receive the world; it projects a hallucination of what it *expects* to see. [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3639403) [14](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-purpose/202311/the-predictive-brain-and-the-hard-problem-of-consciousness#) [15](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Whatever%20next.pdf) [16](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/whatever-next-predictive-brains-situated-agents-and-the-future-of-cognitive-science/33542C736E17E3D1D44E8D03BE5F4CD9) [17](https://dokumen.pub/expected-experiences-the-predictive-mind-in-an-uncertain-world-9780367535476-9780367540197-9781003084082.html) [18](https://scispace.com/pdf/are-we-predictive-engines-perils-prospects-and-the-puzzle-of-57mhcorkxc.pdf) [19](https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=ijurca) [20](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338217008_Learning_to_Be_Conscious) [21](https://dokumen.pub/the-philosophy-and-science-of-predictive-processing-1350099759-9781350099753.html) [22](https://dokumen.pub/surfing-uncertainty-prediction-action-and-the-embodied-mind-reprintnbsped-0190933216-9780190933210.html) 

*   The brain only allows "prediction errors" (surprises) to pass through the valve.
*   If you walk into your living room, you don't actually "see" the couch in high definition. Your brain predicts the couch is there. You only "see" it if it has been moved or slashed open (a prediction error). This saves massive amounts of processing power.

#### 4. The Default Mode Network (DMN)
The DMN is a network of interacting brain regions active when a person is not focused on the outside world (daydreaming, self-referencing, thinking about the past/future).
*   Current theories (such as the **REBUS model** by Robin Carhart-Harris) suggest the DMN acts as a high-level "valve" or orchestrator of the ego. It imposes rigid narratives on reality to keep the world orderly.

### V. When the Valve Opens
We can understand the valve better by observing what happens when it malfunctions or is chemically altered.

1.  **Psychedelics:** Compounds like psilocybin and LSD suppress the Default Mode Network. They "relax" the high-level beliefs (priors). The valve widens.
    *   **Result:** The user perceives "more" reality, colors are brighter, objects seem alive with meaning, and connections between unrelated concepts become visible. The filter that separates "self" from "environment" dissolves.
2.  **Schizophrenia:** This can be viewed as an inability to filter. The "aberrant salience" hypothesis suggests that the brain assigns high significance to meaningless background noise. A car honking isn't just a noise; it is a message meant specifically for the individual. The valve is broken, and the flood of data creates a terrifying, over-connected reality.
3.  **Autism (The Intense World Theory):** Some researchers propose that autism is not a deficit of processing, but an *excess*. The valve is too open, leading to sensory overload. The repetitive behaviors (rocking, stimming) are attempts to create a predictable, controlled input to soothe the overwhelming influx of reality.

The concept of the "cognitive valve" is not just poetic; it is a structural reality.
*   **Philosophically:** It reminds us that our "truth" is merely a survival map, not the territory itself.
*   **Neurologically:** It is the sum of inhibitory mechanisms (thalamic gating, latent inhibition, DMN) that prevent us from drowning in the data of the universe.

We are designed to see a narrow, user-friendly slice of the cosmos. To see it *all* would not make us enlightened; biologically speaking, it would make us extinct.

# Part II - Mechanical Valve Types

Pressure control systems use distinct valves for managing pressure: Pressure Relief/Release Valves safely vent excess gas or liquid when systems exceed safety limits, while Pressure Regulating/Reducing Valves and Injection/Check Valves control, reduce, or inject pressure into a system. [23](https://blog.hayespump.com/blog/understanding-pressure-relief-and-check-valves-in-pumping-systems) [24](https://www.agmcontainer.com/product-category/pressure-control/breather-valves) [25](https://www.theleeco.com/insights/what-is-a-pressure-relief-valve-and-how-does-it-work/) [26](https://www.commercial-industrial-supply.com/blogs/resource-center/a-complete-guide-of-what-to-know-about-pressure-reducing-valves) [27](https://www.glascol.com/glassware/pressure-release-valves)

## 1. Key Valve Types and Functions:

### 1.1 Pressure Relief/Release Valves: 
These are safety devices that remain closed until pressure hits a specific limit, at which point they open to vent excess pressure to prevent system failure. [28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/relief-valve)

### 1.2 Air Release/Vacuum Breaker Valves: 
Used in piping to automatically release accumulated air pockets, preventing water hammer and inefficiencies.

### 1.3 Pressure Reducing/Regulating Valves: 
These control the downstream pressure to a desired, lower level, acting proactively rather than reactively.

### 1.4 Injection/Check Valves: 
These allow flow in only one direction, ensuring materials are injected without backflow. 
 [29](https://avtekvalves.com/a-quick-and-simple-guide-to-air-release-valves/) [30](https://hydraulicspecialty.com/direct-acting-vs-pilot-operated-relief-valves) [31](https://goldfarbinc.com/blogs/news/how-the-delivery-valve-design-affects-fuel-pressure-control) [32](https://www.britishgas.co.uk/heating/guides/what-is-a-pressure-relief-valve.html) [33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMnRFTxi-dQ) [34](https://goldfarbinc.com/blogs/news/how-the-delivery-valve-design-affects-fuel-pressure-control)
 
These valves are essential for maintaining safety and efficiency in boilers, compressors, and hydraulic systems.

# Part III Constructal Theory vs Information Theory

I argue that a mechanical valve regulating industrial pressure and a thalamic gate filtering sensory data are not merely similar but both instantiations of the same thermodynamical underlying principle: the constrained optimization of flow through a bounded system. (Constructal Law or Constructal Theory). [35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0017931004000523) [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2871904)

Constructal theory defines the generation of geometric form (structure, shape, topology) in nature as the optimization of flow access under constraints. 
[37](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243582018_Thermodynamic_Optimization_of_Flow_Geometry_in_Mechanical_and_Civil_Engineering)

It is a law of physics stating that all flow systems (natural or human-made) evolve in time to increase access to flow, creating tree-like,, hierarchical, or, dendritic configurations to minimize resistance. 

It was discovered and formulated by Adrian Bejan, a Romanian-American professor of mechanical engineering at Duke University, in 1996. [38](https://mems.duke.edu/impact/research/energy/bejan-constructal-law) [39](https://medium.com/@jmullaly/on-constructal-law-and-theory-967c81a42565) [40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Bejan) [41](https://www.eoht.info/page/Constructal%20theory)

It posits that for a finite-size system to persist in time (to live), it must evolve in such a way that it provides easier access to the imposed currents that flow through it.

The optimization is subject to constraints, such as limited space, materials, or volume (e.g., maximizing heat transfer while restricting material volume).
Mechanism: It explains the natural formation of tree-shaped flow structures, branching networks, and vascularization in both animate (rivers, lungs) and inanimate systems (power plants, heat exchangers).

The objective is to maximize global performance, which is equivalent to minimizing overall flow resistance or minimizing entropy generation. [42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735193323003366) [43](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/appliedmechanicsreviews/article-abstract/59/5/269/446372/Constructal-Theory-From-Engineering-to-Physics-and?redirectedFrom=PDF) [44](https://fullpdfword.org/reviews/u4A87D/245592/4968440-advanced-engineering-thermodynamics-bejan)

It provides a physical basis for natural patterns, including the evolution of shapes in biology and technology and it is considered a fundamental, unifying law that covers natural, human-made, and social systems.
